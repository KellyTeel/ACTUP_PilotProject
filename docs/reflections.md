# Problems and Possibilities 

It is pertinent to this project that the viewer understands the context in which the ACT UP Oral History Project exists. It was created in the early 2000s and is a reflection of trends in the Humanities as well as Gender Studies. In the last decades there has been a noticable increase in LGBTQ and Queer scholarship. There emphasis on identity, memory, and oral history has also increased within the fields of Humanities and Gender Studies. Scholars of both fields, in collaboration with universities and private organizations, have offered up signinicant digital sources in the last two decades as well. While reflecting on this project as a whole we are cognizant that many of these sources wouldn't have been available 5, 10, and 15 years ago, much less 20 or 30 years ago. These digitized collections broaden the discourse on LGBTQ history and enable access to an enormous audience of scholars and the public in general.  

Although we were not able to accomplish everything that we had hoped for due to being novices to the Digital Humanities, we are proud of ourselves for what we were able to accomplish. Our concepts still have potential to be developed as we become familiar with more applications and tools. 

Even before we were able to think of visualizing the data, we had to obtain it. We tried to scrape the data from ACT UP several times, the results were inadequate, and quite disappointing. We communicated this MAJOR ISSUE to David Thomas and he advised us he could provide us with the files. While we were grateful for his generosity, we were disappointed we didn't get the satisfaction of scraping the data ourselves. Once we recieved the txt files, we were thrilled and started imagining all of the possibilities for our project.  

We hoped we would be able to make grand visualizations. We initially believed we could potentially feed the interviews into Orange Three, Tableau, or Gephi, and we would easily make graphs,maps, and charts... that was not so. The Digital Humanities are not suited for quitters, things will go wrong, they will not look like you conceived initially. Or they won't look like anything at all because they will fail to upload. Additionally, both of us experienced our computers freezing or applications shutting down while we were making visualizations. Tableau crashed Kelly's computer several times, that is why all of the Tableau visualizations had to be taken care of by Catherine. Orange Three shut down on Catherine's computer about two dozen times. Each time these programs failed to work, or crashed and lost our work, we discussed, changed our plan, and kept on trying. 

Communication as well as mutual respect is 100% necessary for a Digital Humanities collaboration to be successful. Although our plan wasn't always successful, our collaboration continued to be, due to our team reinforcing eachother and the mission of the project. We never had any difficulties communicating, we used Slack, GitHub, as well as email and text messages. Catherine initially had issues understanding how to use GitHub, but Kelly took the time to show her how it worked.   



You should talk about where you group encountered the most difficulties. What was the hardest about scraping, or visualizing, or locating historiography? Did you have problems communicating or sharing files on GitHub?

What problems stopped you dead in the water? Did you have to change course mid-project to account for data that you could not get, or was not what you thought?

Moving on from problems, let's the reader on a positive note. What worked best, where did you think the strength of the project was? What were the most useful historical insights? What were the most useful tools?

Finally, think of future attempts to continue this line of research, whether by yourself or others. Where do you want to go with it. What areas do you think could be expanded easily? You can discuss what you wish you could have done but could not due to lack of time/skill/et.c. But, much more than that, what would you suggest would be the most useful thing(s) you think could actually be accomplished in the space of another semester?
