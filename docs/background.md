# Project Background 

---

The discourse on the AIDS crisis, and the origins of AIDS/HIV activism began in the early 80s, well before there was a title for the virus and disease. The earliest publications discussing the disease referred to it using homophobic rhetoric calling it a “gay plague” and “gay cancer.” The reasoning for the term “gay cancer,” correlates to Kaposi Sarcoma, which causes cancerous lesions in the soft tissue of people with AIDS (PWA); the term “gay plague,” was associated with Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia that often burdened PWA. Due to homophobic attitudes around the disease, the response from the government and medical community was slow to offer meaningful assistance to infected individuals and their partners. The marginalization and endangerment of PWA lead to many advocacy groups forming in the 80s. One group in particular, ACT UP, was formed in 1987 in response to the government and medical community’s neglect of PWA.

## Historical Background

Tamar Carroll, a U.S. historian focusing on gender and sexuality as well as public and digital history, offers an analysis of AIDS related activism in the United States. Carroll’s "Mobilizing New York: AIDS, Antipoverty, and Feminist Activism" provides insight into ACT UP and Women’s Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM) coming together in 1991 to protest inadequate access to women’s healthcare and abortion services in New York. Carrol argues that the two organizations coming together provided the two communities with an  “immediate sense of connection.” (Carroll, 133-134) Including this information, offers consideration of ACT UP’s activism for purposes that were not inherently AIDS related. A lack of access to equitable healthcare was a uniting topic for LGBTQ activists and women’s rights activists. Carroll argues that prior feminist activism provided ACT UP with inspiration and methods for resistance. (Carroll, 137) As did Stonewall, and LGBT activism from the 50s and 60s. 

An inadequate government response to the AIDS crisis, lead to individuals unifying and forming ACT UP, the government’s neglect lead to community building. This is not the first occurrence of American citizens forming a community in response to systematic inequity. As David Johnson’s "The Lavender Scare:The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in theFederal Government" demonstrates, during the Cold War, oppression of homosexuals was common practice and government oppression lead to resistance and activism. Johnson argues, “ Through publicity, lobbying, demonstrations, and litigation, gay men and lesbians succeeded in dismantling the policies designed to exclude them from governmental service. Thus the policies meant to counter the power and influence of gay civil servants actually fostered the creation of an effective and influential political gay pressure group.” (Johnson, Epilogue) Johnson's history shows that the LGBT community was familiar with political activism by the time of the AIDS crisis, which provides insight into why the organization was able to establish such an enormous mobilized community in New York City, that would lead to eighty ACT UP chapters by 1993. (Cohen, 15)

The actions and successes of ACT UP stood partially upon the shoulders of previous organizations and their members. As Cohen's "Love and Anger: Essays on AIDS, Activism, and Politics" explains, Larry Kramer, the man traditionally credited with the formation of ACT UP, was a member of the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) since 1982.Kramer was displeased with the organizations brand of AIDS activism, so he disbanded and formed ACT UP in March of 1987. (Cohen, 15) Cohen describes Kramer as a leader that had a habit of promoting violence and castigating politicians that didn't act in fashions that he approved. (Cohen 33, 61) Cohen continues that Kramer's suggested use of violence made numerous ACT UP members uncomfortable. (Cohen, 61)

Cohen's Love and anger primarily examines the social and literary response to the AIDS crisis, considering class and social inequalities. Because of Cohen's consideration of class, he is able to examine the "passing" that many white gay men experienced OK HERE TALK ABOUT CLASS AND HOW THEIR WHITE MALE PRIVLEDGE WORKED, AND HOW THIS WORKS IN AN INTERSECTIONAL ANALYSIS.

## Digital Background

After attending LA’s Queer Studies conference in 2011, Alexis Lothian an assistant professor of Women’s Studies and LGBT Studies at the University of Maryland College Park, composed a blog post explaining the difficulties for scholars of gender studies to engage with the digital humanities. Lothian considers the fact that even if a scholar creates a digital project, they may not consider themselves a digital humanist, or refer to their work as a digital project. Lothian explains, “My experience suggests that many, many politicized queers and people of color engaged in scholarly work in and out of the academy do use digital tools and think critically about them and even create them; they just don’t necessarily do so under the sign of the digital humanities.” Lothian also outlines the topics that are discussed at many conferences, demonstrating that important questions are being raised, such as: What are the digital humanities? What is the impact of technology in humanist and gender scholarship? And, importantly the conferences tend to consider the question of representation of LGBTQ and people of color in the digital humanities.

In 2015, an article titled “Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities” appeared in Digital Humanities Quarterly. Roopika Risam a scholar of digital humanities and the African diaspora, authored the article. Risam posed useful questions and expanded the dialogue on inclusivity and intersectionality in the digital humanities community. Risam’s article suggests that while there is much work to be done, in recent years people of color, women, and the LGBTQ community are increasingly joining the discourse of digital humanities; and these groups have increasingly produced or collaborated on meaningful digital humanities projects. Risam’s article is pertinent to our project due to our own considerations of an intersectional analysis, and why we found it to be a particularly useful lens to use as we explored ACT UP’s digital oral history repository. As Risam argues, “Existing digital humanities projects provide examples of how, in small and large ways, theory and method can be combined to address recurring questions of the role of race, class, gender, ability, sexuality, nationality, and other categories of difference within the field.” 

All of Risam’s topics of consideration: race, gender, class, sexuality, gender identity, ability and nationality are captured within ACT UP’s digital collection. No, ACT UP’s DH project was not created as an inherently “digital humanities” project per se, but as Lothian has pointed out, even if it was not originally intended to serve as an example of a DH project, it still exists as one. Importantly, the consideration of  various demographics of people, as well as individuals from those communities offering digital projects, reshapes the façade of the DH community. Additionally, as the DH community becomes more diverse, there is a likelihood that diversity will increase over time. Risam considers how utilizing a specific theory, such as intersectionality, doesn’t just offer race, gender, and class diversity, it also offers intellectual diversity. From engaging with Risam’s article one may discern that individuals are complex, as are DH projects, and advancements can come from making use of an intersectional lens. Advancements can come from a heterogenous group of people collaborating, posing significant questions, and answering in distinct fashions. Risam makes it unambiguously clear that the theories and methods behind a DH collabortation are just as important as the digital aspects.

Dan Royals, a professor of history at Florida International University, focuses on oral histories, the digital humanities and the recent past. In October of 2017, Royals offered up a tremendously inciteful article titled, “Directions for Digital HIV/AIDS History.”  The article was featured on Process, the Organization of American Historians’ blog. The relevance of Royals’ article to our project is profound, the title alone signaled how pertinent this writing would be for our study. Royals argues that it is necessary for the history of AIDS to be written and communicated in a digital format. Royals celebrates digital archives and asserts that the accessibility of digital archives and searchability via metadata is pertinent when building a digital archive. He also celebrates the global collaborations that are possible due to the digital humanities, this very project on ACT UP is a collaboration, as is Process, the blog this writing appears on.      

The ACT UP Oral History Project is mentioned by name in this article, Royals considers the collection’s potential in his discussion of text analysis, asserting “Historians of HIV/AIDS could similarly look for linguistic and conceptual patterns in AIDS reportage, academic journals, or the oral histories produced by the AIDS Oral History Project and the ACT UP Oral History Project.” Regarding network analysis, Royals suggests that one could trace activists’ connections based on events that they attended and organizations they were involved with. The capabilities appear endless after reading Royals’ article. And, that is the purpose of the article, to show that digital humanities offer a medium with truly inventive potential for dispersing knowledge and deriving meaning.
