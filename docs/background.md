The discourse on the AIDS crisis, and the origins of AIDS/HIV activism began in the late 70s and early 80s, well before there was a title for the virus and disease. The earliest publications discussing the disease referred to it using homophobic rhetoric calling it a “gay plague” and “gay cancer.” The reasoning for the term “gay cancer,” correlates to Kaposi Sarcoma, which causes cancerous lesions in the soft tissue of people with AIDS (PWA); the term “gay plague,” was associated with Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia that often burdened PWA. Due to homophobic attitudes around the disease, the response from the government and medical community was slow to offer meaningful assistance to infected individuals and their partners. The marginalization and endangerment of PWA lead to many advocacy groups forming in the 80s. One group in particular, ACT UP, was formed in 1987 in response to the government and medical community’s neglect of PWA.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
