# Project Background 

---

The discourse on the AIDS crisis, and the origins of AIDS/HIV activism began in the early 80s, well before there was a title for the virus and disease. The earliest publications discussing the disease referred to it using homophobic rhetoric calling it a “gay plague” and “gay cancer.” The reasoning for the term “gay cancer,” correlates to Kaposi Sarcoma, which causes cancerous lesions in the soft tissue of people with AIDS (PWA); the term “gay plague,” was associated with Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia that often burdened PWA. Due to homophobic attitudes around the disease, the response from the government and medical community was slow to offer meaningful assistance to infected individuals and their partners. The marginalization and endangerment of PWA lead to many advocacy groups forming in the 80s. One group in particular, ACT UP, was formed in 1987 in response to the government and medical community’s neglect of PWA.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

After attending LA’s Queer Studies conference in 2011, Alexis Lothian an assistant professor of Women’s Studies and LGBT Studies at the University of Maryland College Park, composed a blog post explaining the difficulties for scholars of gender studies to engage with the digital humanities. Lothian considers the fact that even if a scholar creates a digital project, they may not consider themselves a digital humanist, or refer to their work as a digital project. Lothian explains, “My experience suggests that many, many politicized queers and people of color engaged in scholarly work in and out of the academy do use digital tools and think critically about them and even create them; they just don’t necessarily do so under the sign of the digital humanities.” Lothian also outlines the topics that are discussed at many conferences, demonstrating that important questions are being raised, such as: What are the digital humanities? What is the impact of technology in humanist and gender scholarship? And, importantly the conferences tend to consider the question of representation of LGBTQ and people of color in the digital humanities.

In 2015, an article titled “Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities” appeared in Digital Humanities Quarterly. Roopika Risam a scholar of digital humanities and the African diaspora, authored the article. Risam posed useful questions and expanded the dialogue on inclusivity and intersectionality in the digital humanities community. Risam’s article suggests that while there is much work to be done, in recent years people of color, women, and the LGBTQ community are increasingly joining the discourse of digital humanities; and these groups have increasingly produced or collaborated on meaningful digital humanities projects. Risam’s article is pertinent to our project due to our own considerations of an intersectional analysis, and why we found it to be a particularly useful lens to use as we explored ACT UP’s digital oral history repository. As Risam argues, “Existing digital humanities projects provide examples of how, in small and large ways, theory and method can be combined to address recurring questions of the role of race, class, gender, ability, sexuality, nationality, and other categories of difference within the field.” 
All of Risam’s topics of consideration: race, gender, class, sexuality, gender identity, ability and nationality are captured within ACT UP’s digital collection. No, ACT UP’s DH project was not created as an inherently “digital humanities” project per se, but as Lothian has pointed out, even if it was not originally intended to serve as an example of a DH project, it still exists as one. Importantly, the consideration of  various demographics of people, as well as individuals from those communities offering digital projects, reshapes the façade of the DH community. Additionally, as the DH community becomes more diverse, there is a likelihood that diversity will increase over time. Risam considers how utilizing a specific theory, such as intersectionality, doesn’t just offer race, gender, and class diversity, it also offers intellectual diversity. From engaging with Risam’s article one may discern that individuals are complex, as are DH projects, and advancements can come from making use of an intersectional lens. Advancements can come from a heterogenous group of people collaborating, posing significant questions, and answering in distinct fashions. Risam makes it unambiguously clear that the theories and methods behind a DH collabortation are just as important as the digital aspects.
