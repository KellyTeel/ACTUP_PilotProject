# Initial Findings  

David Thomas provided our group with txt files that he obtained from a scraping he accoplished in 2017. Upon receipt of the txt files, Catherine attempted to upload them into Tableau. The mission was a failure. After conversations with Kelly, Catherine realized that she could not upload txt files into Tableau, and that data had to be produced through Orange Three first, and a csv file would need to be downladed. 

 After uploading the txt files into Orange Three, Catherine began trying various methods of analysis. Most of them were a downright failure, especially the word cloud that was generated, absolutely no inherent meaning could be derived from the visual Orange Three produced.Catherine imagined that AIDS, ACT, UP, or activism would be the most commonly used words in the word cloud. However that was incorrect, from viewing this visualization, the viewer has absolutely no idea ot context as to what ACT UP's oral histories discuss.   PUT THE PHOTO OF THE WORD CLOUD UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH PLEASE

Catherine decided that she wanted to see how often certain words appeared within the entire collection of oral histories, using Orange Three's concordance tool, she was actually successful at generating meaningful concordances. However, she was unable to produce a visualization from said concordances. PLEASE PUT THE PHOTOS OF THE SILENCE = DEATH CONCORDANCES BENEATH THIS PARAGRAPH
As you can see in the photo above, the Silence = Death campaign was mentioned in 77/186 interviews. The word "silence" was not the only word that Catherine attempted to use to find concordances, she also used the word "AIDS". AIDS proved to be a far more common word than silence, having appeared in every single one of the 186 interviews,it was uttered 7042 times to be exact. From the list of concordaances, one may discern how AIDS was used and words that often came before and after AIDS. 

With the assistance of David Thomas, Catherine was able to successfully save data from Orange Three. The file that Orage Three generated was a csv file. Thomas then aided us in opening the csv file. Initially the file would not open in Tableau. We then opened the file using Excel and we re-saved the file as a csv a second time. Once the file was re-saved in Excel, we attempted to upload it into Tableau, and finally we were able to successfully use Tableau to create a visualization! That was quite a relief. 
We were able to use a sentiment analysis tool in Tableau and produce a horizontal bar graph that depicts the negativity and positivity score of each interview. PLEASE PLACE THE PHOTOS OF THE BAR GRAPH FROM TABLEAU HERE

In the graphs above you can see that each interview has a unique negativity and positivity rating. For example, you can see that the Katz interview is has a far highter positivity than negativity rating. And, Lyons' interview appears to be far more negative than the other interviews in the photo. Additionally in the other photo, you can see that Dorman's negativity rating is very close to the positivity rating, Neg:0.7100 and Pos: .0790. Dorman, like Lyons' interview has the highest negativity ratings within the grouping in the photo, but Lyons'positivity rating, coming in at 0.1110 is much lower than Dorman's. 

One could ask what does this mean? From these visualizations, we believe than one could potentially discern how the subjects talked about the AIDS crisis and their ACT UP membership. Their emotions and sentiments about their lived experience. This is not an exact science, and the meaning derived may be minimal, but there are unique differences from one individual to another and we believe that has the potential to mean something. Additionally, we must consider that this information is not objective. The interviewer, Sarah SCHULMAN SPELL CHECK asked particular people particular questions. These interviews did not occur in a vacuum, nor did the activism they are being interviewed about. Similiarly, we must consider objectivity and bias when we are discussing such a political and highly personal topic such as AIDS activism and activists. The topic of AIDS is one which needs to be approached with sensitivity to begin with, it is a disease that impacted the LGBT community in a disproportionate fashion in the 1980s. People are discussing a time of crisis, death, marginalization, the loss of friends and family. They were also interviewed decades after the initial crisis began, there has been time for individuals to reflect and process their emotions and form opinions.

Whether you turn your visualizations into static pictures and put them here or embed them, you MUST discuss your visualizations adequately. That means that whoever is the visualization expert must explain what they think the visualization means. You should explain anything that is not self-apparent from the picture alone. Moreover, you should at least comment on whether you think you can draw broader conclusions from any of the visualizations, either when considered individually or all together.

If your project was less visualization-centric, this is where you at least explain in plain words what you learned through the process of non-visual analysis. For example, if you used text mining not for visualization purposes, but to help you manually find interesting threads of conversation in a body of documents.

You should also make sure to be a cautious scholar, and to think about the limitations of what the visualizations can actually tell you. As indicated by the section name, you are **not** expected to make hard conclusions that upend serious historical debates. Rather, this is a place to explore what might be learned from visual exploration.

You must also comment on where you would go next. If these are initial findings, where do you think the best profit would be for any future attempts. This is also where you can talk about pitfalls that limited your ability to learn more about the topic. How might future projects overcome these difficulties?
